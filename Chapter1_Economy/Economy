When I wrote the following pages,or rather the bulk of them,I lived alone,in the woods,a mile from any neighbor,in a house which I have built myself,
on the shore of Walden Pond,in Concord,Massachusetts,and earned my living by the labor of my hands only.
I lived there two years and two months.At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.
I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquires had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life,
which some would call impertinent,though they do not appear to me at all impertinent,but considering the circumstances,very natural and pertinent.
