# Walden

*Walden* ,by Henry David Thoreau,is a book which I should have read it many years ago,However,because of my laziness,I have never finished it.

Being a little shame of myself,I decide to type the whole book.Besides,I have found the [*audiobook*](https://archive.org/details/walden_librivox) of it.For me,it is like a background music when I am typing.Hope you enjoy it.

My dear fingers,It is show time, Enjoy typing.
