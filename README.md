# Walden

**Walden**, by *Henry David Thoreau*, is a book which I should have read it many years ago, However, because of my laziness, I have never finished it.

Being a little shame of myself, I decide to type the whole book. Besides, I have found the [*audiobook*](https://archive.org/details/walden_librivox) of it.For me, it is like a background music when I am typing.Hope you enjoy it.

My dear fingers, it is show time, enjoy typing:-)
