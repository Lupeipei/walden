### Chapter 02. Where I Lived,and What I Lived For

At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a house.I have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of where I live.In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession,for all were to be bought,and I knew their price.I walked over each farmer's premises,tasted his wild apples,discoursed on husbandry with him,took his farm at his price,at any price,mortgaging it to him in my mind;even put a higher price on it--took everything but a deed of it--took his word for his deed,for I dearly love to talk--cultivated it,and him too to some extent,I trust,and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough,leaving him to carry it on.This experience entitled me to be regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends.Wherever I sat,there I might live,and the landscape radiated from me accordingly.What is a house but a sedes,a seat?--better if a country seat.I discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved,which some might have thought too far from the village,but to my eyes the village was too far from it.Well,there I might live,I said;and there I did live,for an hour,a summer and a winter life;**saw how I could let the years run off,buffet the winter through,and see the spring come in.** The future inhabitants of this region,wherever they may place their houses,may be sure that they have been anticipated.An afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard,wood-lot,and pasture,and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door,and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage;and then I let it lie,fallow,perchance,for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.

My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several farms--the refusal was all I wanted--but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession.The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place,and had begun to sort my seeds,and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with;but before the owner gave me a deed of it,his wife--every man has such a wife--changed her mind and wished to keep it,and he offered me ten dollars to release him.Now,to speak the truth,I had but ten cents in the world,and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell,if I was  the man who had ten cents,or who had a farm,or ten dollars,or all together.However,I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too,for I had carried it far enough;or rather,to be generous,I sold him the farm just what I gave it,and,as he was not a rich man,made him a present of ten dollars,and still had my ten cents,and seeds,and materials for a wheelbarrow left.I found thus that I had been a rich man without any damage to my poverty.But I retained the landscape,and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow.With respect to landscape,
*"I am monarch of all I survey,My right there is none to dispute."*

I have frequently seen a poet withdraw,having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm,while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only.Why,the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme,the most admirable kind of invisible fence,has fairly impounded it,milked it,skimmed it,and got all the cream,and left the farmer only the skimmer milk.

The real attractions of the Hollowell farm,to me,were:its complete retirement,being,about two miles from the village,half a mile from the nearest neighbor,and separated from the highway by a broad field;its bounding on the river,which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring,though that was nothing to me;the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn,and the dilapidated fences,which put such an interval between me and the last occupant;the hollow and lichen-covered apple tree,nawed by rabbits,showing what kind of neighbors I should have;but above all,the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river,when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples,through which I heard the house-dog bark.I was in haste to buy it,before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks,cutting down the hollow apple trees,and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture,or,in short,had made any more of his improvements.To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on;like Atlas,to take the world on my shoulders--I never heard what compensation he received for that--and do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it;for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted,if I could only afford to let it alone.But it turned out as I have said.

All that I could say,then,with respect to farming on a large scale--I have always cultivated a garden--was,that I had had my seeds ready.Many think that seeds improve with age.I have no doubt that time discriminated between the good and the bad;and when at last I shall plant,I shall be less likely to be disappointed.But I would say to my fellows,once for all,As long as possible live free and uncommitted.It makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the country jail.

Old Cato,whose "De Re Rustica"is my my "Cultivator,"says--and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage--"When you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind,not to buy greedily;nor spare your pains to look at it,and do not think it enough to go around it once.The oftener you go there the more it will please you,if it is good."I think I shall not buy greedily,but go round  and round it as long as I live,and be buried in it first,that it may please me the more at last.

The present was my next experiment of this kind,which I purpose to describe more at length,for convenience putting the experience of two years into one.As I have said,I do not propose to write an ode to dejection,but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning,standing on his roost,if only to wake my neighbors up.

When first I took up my abode in the woods,that is,began to spend my nights as well as days there,which,by accident,was on Independence Day,or the Fourth of July,1845,my house was not finished for winter,but was merely a defence against the rain.without plastering or chimney,the walls being of roungh,weather-stained boards,with wide chinks,which made it cool at night.The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look,especially in the morning,when its timbers were saturated with dew,so that I fancied throughout the day more or less of this auroral character,reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had visited a year before.This was an airy and unplastered cabin,fit to entertain a travelling god,and where a goddess might trail her garments.The winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains,bearing the broken strains,or celestial parts only,of terrestrial music.The morning wind forever blows,the poem of creation is uninterrupted;but few are the ears that hear it.Olympus is but the outside of the earth everywhere.

The only house I had been the owner of before,if I except a boat,was a tent,which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer,and this is still rolled up in my garret;but the boat,after passing from hand to hand,has gone down the stream of time.With this more substantial shelter about me,I had made some progress toward settling in the world.This frame,so slightly clad,was a sort of crystallization around me,and reacted on the builder.It was suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines.**I did not need to go outdoors to take the air,for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness.It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat,even in the rainiest weather.** The Harivansa says,"An abode without birds is like a meat without seasoning."Such was not my abode,for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds;not by having imprisoned one,but having caged myself near them.I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard,but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never,or rarely,serenade a village--the wood thrush,the veery,the scarlet tanager,the field sparrow,the whip-poor-will,and many others.

I was seated by the shore of a small pond,about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it,in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln,and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame,Concord Battle Ground;but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore,half a mile off,like the rest,covered with wood,was my most distant horizon.For the first week,whenever I looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain,its bottom far above the surface of other lakes,and,as the sun arose,I saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist,and here and there,by degrees,its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed,while the mists,like ghosts,were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods,as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle.The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day than usual,as on the sides of mountains.
